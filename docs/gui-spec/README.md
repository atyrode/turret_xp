# Turret XP GUI Spec Assembly

This directory contains the split working spec for the next Turret XP GUI
design. It is produced by [../GUI_SPEC_FACTORY.md](../GUI_SPEC_FACTORY.md)
and assembled from focused contracts so the browser prototype and later Lua
implementation can target named surfaces instead of chat memory.

The older single-file [../TURRET_XP_GUI_SPEC.md](../TURRET_XP_GUI_SPEC.md)
keeps the broad feature inventory and behavior scenarios. These files own the
current design slices used by the browser prototype.

## Assembly Order

1. [factorio-style-notes.md](factorio-style-notes.md): public Factorio web,
   Mod Portal, and API-docs styling notes used to shape local tokens.
2. [core-picker.md](core-picker.md): empty-turret picker contract.
3. [workbench.md](workbench.md): installed-core workbench shell contract.
4. [build-plan.md](build-plan.md): Build Plan mode contract.
5. [stat-inspector.md](stat-inspector.md): pinned consequence panel contract.
6. [browser-prototype.md](browser-prototype.md): prototype tool contract,
   fixture coverage, and stop conditions.
7. [browser-builder-roadmap.md](browser-builder-roadmap.md): future
   Factorio-constrained builder, shared model, Lua skeleton export, and website
   renderer roadmap.

## Current Product Shape

The accepted high-level shape is:

- Empty turret: a focused Core Picker, no dashboard shell.
- Installed turret: one Veteran Core Workbench surface.
- Main workbench body: Progression Editor plus pinned Stat Inspector.
- Build Plan: a mode of the workbench, not a separate tab or page.
- Automation controls: visible where they affect build planning, not isolated
  away from progression feedback.
- Detailed stats, combat history, naming, labels, and dev controls: reachable
  drawers, not primary layout drivers.

## Implementation Rule

New GUI code MUST target this split spec or update it first. The browser
prototype under [../../tools/gui-prototype](../../tools/gui-prototype) is the
first implementation target. Lua implementation is intentionally out of scope
for this branch until the browser prototype passes human visual review.

The broader builder and shared-renderer direction is tracked in
[browser-builder-roadmap.md](browser-builder-roadmap.md). It is intentionally
sequential: static viewer first, constrained layout model next, Lua skeleton
export after that, and only then richer no-code-like editing.

## Drift Rule

When a prototype or Lua screen needs a new anchor, fixture, mode, or component,
update this directory in the same change. Do not let code become the only place
where a design decision exists.
