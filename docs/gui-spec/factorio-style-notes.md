# Factorio Style Notes For Browser Prototype

This note records the public UI surfaces inspected for the browser prototype:

The prototype uses these sources as style references. It MUST NOT vendor large
Wube CSS files, copy minified page styles wholesale, or bundle Wube image
assets. It MAY load the public Titillium Web font from Factorio's CDN with a
local fallback.

Official Factorio API documentation remains authoritative for runtime GUI
behavior. Raiguard's Factorio GUI style guide is the highest-value community
style reference currently tracked here because it focuses directly on
Factorio-like GUI composition and explicitly documents style precepts, element
patterns, and in-game style inspection tools. Treat it as design guidance to
extract into local tokens and constraints, not as license to copy assets.

Raiguard's broader public work is also tracked as a high-value lead. The Mod
Portal lists Raiguard as owner/author for Factorio Library (`flib`), Editor
Extensions, and Krastorio 2. The public Codeberg profile describes Raiguard as
"Game programmer @ Wube Software." That makes the guide and related repositories
especially relevant for Factorio-native GUI taste and architecture research.
Concrete rules should still be cited to the specific page, repository, or file
that was inspected. Editor Extensions is especially relevant to future testing
workflow research because its Mod Portal page describes a separate editor lab
used to design and test away from the main factory.

The style guide's in-game inspection workflow should be treated as part of the
source pipeline. Use graphical Factorio, not headless Factorio, to collect:

- `Ctrl+F6`: GUI style inspector, especially style names and properties;
- `Ctrl+F5`: bounding boxes for element spacing and hit areas;
- `Ctrl+F7`: shadow toggles for checking depth and separation.

Headless Factorio cannot expose these hover/visual overlays because it does not
render GUI surfaces. Captured style-inspector notes should become local tokens,
component constraints, or fixture comments before implementation.

A companion mod can still automate part of this workflow in graphical Factorio.
For Turret XP-owned GUI elements, it can dump the script-visible `LuaGuiElement`
tree and readable `LuaStyle` fields to JSON. Use that for repeatable checks of
element names, style names, declared dimensions, spacing, padding, alignment,
and stretch/squash flags. Keep manual `Ctrl+F6` captures for renderer-computed
values that the mod API does not expose, such as content size, clip size, size
before stretching, relative hover coordinates, and the inspector's derived-style
explanation.

`JanSharp/FactorioGUIEditor` was inspected as a possible existing resource. It
is an in-game Factorio GUI editor prototype with unreleased dependencies, not a
browser renderer. Its useful lesson is constraint awareness: Factorio GUI
stretch/fixed-size combinations, scroll panes, and click-event surfaces can
behave differently from browser layout.

`ClaudeMetz/UntitledGuiGuide` was added as a legacy reference with caution. It
is an older custom Factorio GUI tutorial and explicitly says it is not a style
guide. Use it for practical GUI-building concepts and terminology, not as an
authoritative source over the current Factorio API docs or current in-game
behavior.

## Observed Public Web Tokens

The Factorio website, Mod Portal, and API docs share a compact mechanical
visual language:

- dark brown/black page background;
- dense gray panels with hard corners;
- layered 4 px-ish panel edges and inset shadows;
- Titillium Web for UI copy and headings;
- gold/tan headings for first-read labels;
- orange for selected tabs, hover states, and active affordances;
- blue for links and secondary info;
- green/red only for status, success, harm, or warning semantics;
- gray table rows, alternating row tones, and restrained dividers;
- compact 8 px spacing increments;
- fixed-size slots, square icon buttons, and row rhythm;
- dark scrollbars with gray thumbs and orange hover;
- buttons that feel pressed through inset shadow and small vertical offset.

## Local Prototype Tokens

The browser prototype owns a local token layer rather than copying source CSS:

| Token | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `fx-bg` | dark page/workbench background |
| `fx-panel` | main gray panel fill |
| `fx-panel-light` | raised or selected panel fill |
| `fx-panel-dark` | inset/hole fill |
| `fx-edge` | hard panel edge |
| `fx-gold` | headings and active primary labels |
| `fx-orange` | selected tab/button accent |
| `fx-blue` | links, source chips, info values |
| `fx-green` | beneficial numeric deltas |
| `fx-red` | harmful numeric deltas |
| `fx-muted` | disabled or secondary text |

## Component Translation Targets

| Browser component | Factorio Lua target later |
| --- | --- |
| Window shell | `frame` in `player.gui.relative` or `screen` fallback |
| Title bar | draggable frame title / flow |
| Slot | scripted `sprite-button` preserving Veteran Core tags |
| Segmented mode row | flow of toggle-style buttons |
| Checkbox | `checkbox` with stable action tag |
| Rank stepper | fixed-width flow with minus, value, plus buttons |
| Progression group | shallow frame/flow with section header |
| Stat inspector | pinned frame outside editor scroll pane |
| Picker rows | header/body flows, not native grid-line tables |
| Drawer | collapsible frame or anchored popup depending on Factorio fit |

## Visual Risk Checklist

Reject prototype revisions that:

- use the old left-stats/right-Evolution dashboard split;
- isolate Progression, Stats, and Automation into mutually exclusive tabs;
- show large dead slabs of empty gray panel;
- hide changed stats while editing ranks or Build Plan targets;
- use green/red as decoration instead of numeric meaning;
- add nested cards for every row;
- clip table rows or place text under scrollbars;
- depend on copyrighted Wube image assets for the basic look.
