# Browser Builder And Shared Renderer Roadmap

This roadmap captures the larger direction raised during the GUI redesign
discussion. It is aspirational, but concrete enough to split into future
issues. The current branch does not need to complete every phase.

## End State

The strongest long-term target is one shared Factorio GUI layout model that can
drive three surfaces:

1. a browser review tool for fast design iteration;
2. the in-game Factorio Lua GUI implementation;
3. a read-only or lightly interactive official web page demo.

The ideal is not just visual similarity. The ideal is that browser and in-game
UI are generated from the same constrained model, with explicit places where
Factorio and browser behavior cannot be perfectly identical.

## Core Principle

The builder must edit a Factorio GUI layout model, not arbitrary browser layout.

Factorio GUI is based on primitives such as frames, flows, tables, scroll panes,
sprite buttons, labels, checkboxes, and styles. Browser CSS can emulate many of
those, but browser CSS should not become the source of truth. The model should
be closer to Factorio's GUI API than to Figma, absolute-positioned DOM, or a
general web page builder.

## Why Freeform Dragging Is Rejected First

Freeform pixel dragging is likely to produce layouts that look acceptable in a
browser but translate poorly to Factorio. Known risks:

- Factorio layout is flow/table/style driven, not absolute-position driven.
- Stretch flags and fixed sizes can interact in surprising ways.
- Scroll panes can clip differently from browser overflow containers.
- Some compound elements expose click events differently than their visual
  child structure suggests.
- Native Factorio styles carry behavior and sizing assumptions that CSS can
  only approximate.

This does not mean a no-code-like tool is impossible. It means the tool must
offer constrained operations that preserve translatability.

## Accepted Builder Operations

Future builder operations SHOULD include:

- choose screen fixture;
- edit fixture data;
- reorder major spec components;
- choose approved layout variants;
- toggle density modes;
- tune bounded widths, min/max sizes, and column counts;
- choose Stat Inspector placement from approved positions;
- choose drawer placement from approved positions;
- mark components pinned, scrollable, hidden, or drawer-owned;
- select local style tokens;
- validate constraints continuously;
- export a JSON layout model;
- export a Markdown spec diff;
- export a Lua skeleton with stable anchors and TODO behavior hooks;
- export a prompt pack an agent can use to implement the Lua slice.

Future builder operations SHOULD NOT include, at least initially:

- arbitrary x/y positioning;
- arbitrary nested boxes without component contracts;
- arbitrary CSS values with no Factorio equivalent;
- direct behavior generation beyond structural event hook placeholders;
- using the old Turret XP GUI architecture as a model.

## Shared Model Sketch

The shared model can start small:

```json
{
  "schema": "turret-xp.factorio-gui-layout.v0",
  "screen": "installed_workbench",
  "fixture": "installed_level_100_unspent",
  "layout": {
    "density": "compact",
    "inspectorPlacement": "right",
    "primaryScroll": "turret_xp_progression_editor"
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "turret_xp_workbench_header",
      "primitive": "frame",
      "direction": "horizontal",
      "styleToken": "header_band"
    },
    {
      "id": "turret_xp_progression_editor",
      "primitive": "scroll-pane",
      "policy": "vertical-auto",
      "children": ["core_upgrades", "role_path", "elements", "augments"]
    },
    {
      "id": "turret_xp_stat_inspector",
      "primitive": "frame",
      "pinned": true,
      "outsideScrollPane": "turret_xp_progression_editor"
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "no_absolute_positioning",
    "inspector_outside_editor_scroll",
    "no_old_two_column_dashboard"
  ]
}
```

The first model does not need to represent all Factorio style fields. It should
represent enough structure that browser rendering, Lua skeleton generation, and
agent-readable specs can stay in sync.

## Constraint Catalog To Build

The builder needs a catalog of Factorio GUI constraints. Official Factorio API
docs are the authoritative source for engine behavior. Raiguard's Factorio GUI
style guide is the preferred community source for Factorio-like composition,
style naming, and inspection workflow. Older community documentation, including
`ClaudeMetz/UntitledGuiGuide`, may be used cautiously as supporting context
when it helps explain practical custom-GUI workflows. Raiguard's public
Codeberg repositories, especially `flib`, Editor Extensions, Krastorio 2, and
GUI-heavy utility mods, are a lead list for deeper architecture/style research;
record concrete conclusions only after inspecting the specific repository/file.

Initial entries:

- valid primitive types and their child rules;
- direction support for frames and flows;
- table column count and row-building rules;
- scroll-pane policy and maximum-size rules;
- stretchable versus fixed-size interaction risks;
- stable anchor and action-name requirements;
- prohibited resemblance checks from the GUI spec;
- style token mapping to `prototypes/styles.lua`, `flib`, or local styles;
- event-surface notes for frames, scroll panes, and compound controls;
- portability warnings where browser behavior cannot match Factorio exactly.

This catalog should be written before trying a sophisticated builder UI.

The in-game style tools belong in this catalog workflow. `Ctrl+F6` opens the GUI
style inspector in graphical Factorio and should be used to capture style names
and properties from vanilla and high-quality mod GUIs. `Ctrl+F5` shows bounding
boxes and `Ctrl+F7` toggles shadows; these are visual review aids, not headless
test inputs. Factorio headless cannot provide the style-inspector hover overlay
because it has no rendered GUI surface.

Automated text extraction is still possible in graphical Factorio. A companion
mod or Turret XP debug remote can traverse the mod-owned GUI tree and write a
JSON dump with `LuaGuiElement` data such as element type, name, caption,
children, tags, root, and assigned style plus readable `LuaStyle` fields such
as style name, width/height, natural/min/max dimensions, margins, padding,
spacing, font, colors, alignment, and stretch/squash flags. That dump should be
captured next to screenshot artifacts.

Do not mistake that dump for the full `Ctrl+F6` inspector. The inspector also
shows renderer-computed data such as hovered relative position, rendered size,
content size, clip size, size before stretching, derived-style resolution, and
child class/rendered-size summaries. Those computed overlay fields are not
documented `LuaGuiElement`/`LuaStyle` members and cannot be extracted from
Factorio headless through the normal mod API.

## Sequential Spike Plan

### Phase 0: Static Browser Viewer

Status: current PR scope.

- Render required fixtures.
- Use Factorio-inspired local tokens.
- Keep old GUI code as feature inventory only.
- Prove progression and stat feedback can live on the same surface.

### Phase 1: Layout Model Export

- Serialize the current prototype into a JSON layout model.
- Include spec anchors, primitives, component ownership, and constraints.
- Add a Markdown export that explains the selected layout.
- Add validation that required anchors exist in the model.

### Phase 2: Lua Skeleton Export

- Generate structural Lua with named anchors.
- Emit TODO action hooks instead of pretending behavior is complete.
- Keep generated Lua in a scratch/export surface until reviewed.
- Document which parts are generated and which must be hand-authored.

### Phase 3: Constrained Builder UI

- Add controls for fixture editing, component reordering, layout variants,
  density, widths, and drawer placement.
- Validate every change against the constraint catalog.
- Reject or warn on combinations known to translate poorly to Factorio.

### Phase 4: Dual Renderer

- Render the same JSON model to browser DOM and Factorio Lua skeleton.
- Keep browser and Lua component names aligned.
- Add structural tests comparing model anchors to Lua GUI anchors.
- Start measuring where 1:1 parity is possible and where it is approximate.

### Phase 5: Official Web Demo

- Reuse the browser renderer on the public docs/site if licensing and package
  size remain acceptable.
- Keep it read-only or fixture-driven unless editing has a clear user benefit.
- Use it to explain the mod's progression workbench to players.

## Open Questions

- How much of Factorio style definitions can be represented without copying
  Wube assets or overfitting to one game version?
- Should the model target raw Factorio GUI primitives, `flib`, local helper
  primitives, or a layered mapping?
- How strict should 1:1 parity be before Lua implementation starts?
- Which visual differences are acceptable between browser and in-game output?
- Should generated Lua skeletons be committed, or treated as temporary build
  artifacts until reviewed?
- Can screenshot comparison later detect model drift, or should human visual
  review remain the only taste gate?
